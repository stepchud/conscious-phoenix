BUGZ:
Needs testing: pass law(s) and death on the same turn (esp. for hasnamuss with roll multiples)
After death w/ Astral - extra chip on air went under note instead of accumulating on end (UI bug, seemed to be accurate for 3-3-1 still)
After death w/ Astral, gained mental upon death, all notes were wiped (no food) on next facet
Afetr death w/ Astral & Hasnamuss, reincarnated but the Astral pieces were removed
After death w/ Astral, gained mental but the notes didn't shift immediately, after a roll they did
* Started Over - kept playing the game, didn't "start over"
Cleansed Hasnamuss, rolled 5, took opposite => 95??
Played XJ to make school w/ KH, KC - said I was a Yogi (not sure what kind of school this is?)
Active cards not preserved after game save and switch browser session
Board moving animation on mobile size
Buttons second row has no top margin

FEATURES:
Allow player to 'exit' game before others
Indicaate a player is out of the game instead of "Waiting for turn..." when they don't survive death
If a player is not responding, timeout to next turn?
