Astral body:

Decay:
- Mental body players place their decaying matter to the Universe, placing it on the board beginning with the closest corresponding game-space in front of their playing piece. Only
1 chip can occupy any game-space. The first player to land on one of these game-spaces takes in double.
- Living players cannot take chips that were given to the Universe by non-living players.

Hasnamuss:
- If you land on a Hasnamuss, you do not get the space landed on.
- If a Hasnamuss lands on you, he can ask you for a specific card, you must give it to him.
- If you attain the same state of ‘I’ as a Hasnamuss and then land on a Hasnamuss - you are destroyed!

Man #7:
- If a living player Starts Over, all players who haven't qualified for school, attain school... by virtue of there being a Man # 7 in the world!
